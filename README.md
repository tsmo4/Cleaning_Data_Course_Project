The script merges the data collected from the "training" and "testing" phases of the experiment, into a single dataset for
analysis.  

The analysis stage Averages the catgorized means collected in the data collection stage.

The produced data (tidydata.txt) are those catagorized means, crosstabbed by Subject and Activity Name.

The script requires the "plyr" R package.  

R's working directory should be set to the master director of the dataset.
