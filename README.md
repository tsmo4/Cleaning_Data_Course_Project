Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
============================
Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R is a script that processes dataset gathered by the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" 
experments.

A description of the expermtation phase can be found at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The expermentaion phase data can be downloaded at:

The run_analysis.R script merges the data collected from the "training" and "testing" phases of the experiment, 
into a single dataset for analysis.  

The script produces an Average for each Mean and Standard Deviation measurment collected in the Expermentation phase. 
The script outputs a table of these computed Averages to a text file (tidydata.txt) crosstabbed by Subject and Activity Type.

The script requires the "plyr" R package.  

R's working directory should be set to the master director of the dataset.

Credits for the dataset is as follows
